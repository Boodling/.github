# Welcome to Boodle! 🐞

This is a software playground—a place to tinker, experiment, and have fun with code. Think of it as a sandbox for random ideas and side projects.

Here’s what you might find here:

- ⚡ Go – backend experiments and utilities
- ⚛️ React – frontend components, UIs, and interactive bits

Feel free to explore, peek around, or get inspired. There are no rules here… just code, curiosity, and a little chaos. 🚀
